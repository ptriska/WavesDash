Input data format

variant data
tab-delimited
header:
variant (string) name of the variant (e.g. BA.1)
LocationID (string) ID of the sampling area
LocationName (string) plain text name of the sampling area
sample_id (string) ID of the sample
sample_date (string, YYYY-MM-DD) sampling date
value (float between 0 and 1) frequency of detected variant in the sample

allele data
tab-delimited
header:
Sample_ID (string) must correspond to the Sample_ID in the variant frequency file
position (integer) position in the genome
chrom (string) genomic feature ID (reference seq ID)
ref (string) reference allele
alt (string) alternative allele
ann_effect (["missense_variant","synonymous variant"]) effect of the mutation
